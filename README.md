This is me following the instructions on the website, and possibly tweaking
and discovering things throughout the lesson.

To future me: If ever you are reading this, do NOT give up, if you're feeling
like it. Remember your goals, ensure to expand your skills.

If you were able to make it, congratulations! that's for sure a job well done.
Edit this README.md if ever you think that you were able to improve a lot and
get a job as a developer.

Keep it going!
